                <h2>Behind the Landscape</h2>
                <p>Using the data of over 13,000 designers, the making of this project consisted of analyzing and filtering results in order to indentify trends in designers that reached career successes. Below is the unpacking of this data and why and how each component of the landscape was created.</p>

                <h4> With the raw data from the AIGA Design Census conducted in 2017, we identified six distinct success types through questions such as 'what is your income?' and 'how stable is your job,' and compared these success groups responses for the following four questions. We aimed to identify how these groups responses differed from the entire response group.</h4>
